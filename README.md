Iris Detection and Comparison

This project implements an iris detection 
and comparison system using image processing
and pattern recognition techniques. 
The application extracts visual features of
the iris from images, including texture and
color histogram data, and generates a unique
feature descriptor. Using Euclidean distance
as a similarity metric, the system compares 
these descriptors to determine if two iris 
images are visually similar. This process 
involves preprocessing steps such as 
Gaussian blurring and thresholding for 
accurate contour detection, followed by 
feature extraction and comparison. The 
project demonstrates practical applications
in biometric authentication and pattern recognition.
